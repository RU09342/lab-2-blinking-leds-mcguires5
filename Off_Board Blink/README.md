# Off Board Blink
This exercise involves blinking 2 leds on a breadboard using the MSP430G2553. One led blinks at a constant rate while the speed of the other led can be changed by pressing a button. Every time the button is pressed the 2nd led will blink at a rate twice as slow as its previous rate. This continues until it is blinking at 8x slower than the first led. Then when the button is pressed it will reset so the leds blink at the same rate.

## The offboard blink was created for the following board:
* MSP430G2553

# Extra Work
## Button Controlled Speed Variation
The offboard blink was implemented with two leds. One that blinks at a constant rate and another which blinks at a speed varried by a button.
