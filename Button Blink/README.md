# Button Blink
This project shows how a simple button activated LED will work using polling. Polling means that the value of the pin for the button is checked every time it is possible to check and the if the value changes an action is taken, in our case if the button is pulled low then the LED will turn on. The button work with a pull up ressistor so it has an active low behavior.
